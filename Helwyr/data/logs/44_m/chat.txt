[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:05:29 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Because what i was adding was
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:05:34 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Everytime you buy a item
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:05:38 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] It will take out tax
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:05:44 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Wud be nice

[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:34:06 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] How would you feel about this content idea
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:34:09 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Its a economy sinker
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:34:13 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] But again can fill it back in
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:34:17 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Everytime you buy an item
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:34:28 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] It takes a 10% tax
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:34:32 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] So if an item is worth 200k
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:34:35 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] You'll spend 220k
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:34:50 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Every coin spent into tax
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:34:56 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] 10% less
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:35:03 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] But
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:35:11 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Every coin is stored into a variable
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:35:15 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] And at the end of the week
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:35:33 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] All the tax can be split up to 5 players
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:35:36 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Depending how much is saved up
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:35:44 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] But, theres a chance the server can keep it for it self.
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:35:53 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] = the money sink
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:36:03 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] If not, its put back into the servers players
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:36:08 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] But for those who have paid a good amount
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:36:13 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] So if you're new and have only paid 40k in tax
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:36:21 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] You can't receive anything at the end of the weeek
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:36:50 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] No
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:37:04 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Because it dont matter
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:37:08 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] How much you put into taxes
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:37:12 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Aslong as you meet the requirement
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:37:45 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Yeah
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:37:52 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] So if everyone met the requirement
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:37:55 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Everyone has a chance to win
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:37:58 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] But its 5 different people 
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:38:03 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Yes and no
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:38:05 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] But it could even be
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:38:07 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] The poorest person
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:38:09 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Who wins it
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:38:41 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] But every player is required to pay 10m/w
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:38:44 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] To even qualifiy
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:38:57 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Well

[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:39:12 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Its going to be like ~10m 
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:39:14 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] If not 10
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:39:17 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Depending how long it takes to take
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:39:25 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] But pretty much just overtime i'll get a number set
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:39:28 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Nothing is set its just the idea

[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:40:46 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] If theres less of the item price increases
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:40:51 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] If theres more of the itme, price decreases
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:52:23 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Also we have player owned kingdoms
[Tue 01.31.2017 at 10:52:25 PM CET] [68.53.103.14] [PRIVATE] Those make decent $
